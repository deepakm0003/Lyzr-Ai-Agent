Metrics & Formulas
1. Break-Even Point
Break–Even Queries = Fixed Monthly Cost ÷ (Manual Cost per Task – AI Cost per Task)

2. Prompt Compression Efficiency
Compression Gain (%) = ((Original Tokens – Compressed Tokens) ÷ Original Tokens) × 100

3. System Message Reduction Efficiency
Efficiency Gain = (Verbose Tokens – Minimized Tokens) ÷ Verbose Tokens × 100

4. Batching Efficiency
Cost per Task (Batched) = Total Cost of Batch ÷ Number of Tasks in Batch

5. Stop Sequence Optimization
Avg Saved Tokens = Avg Output Tokens – Avg Output Tokens with Stop Sequence

6. Decision Accuracy (%)
Accuracy = (Correct Decisions ÷ Total Decisions) × 100

7. Context Adherence Score
Context Score = Relevant Tokens Used ÷ Total Context Tokens

8. Instruction Compliance Rate
Compliance (%) = Compliant Responses ÷ Total Responses × 100

9. Knowledge Base Hit Rate
KB Hit Rate = (KB Queries with Valid Results ÷ Total KB Queries) × 100

10. Response Latency
Latency = Model Inference Time + Network Time + Pre/Post Processing

11. Throughput (tasks/sec)
Throughput = Total Tasks ÷ Total Time (sec)

12. Token Throughput
Token Throughput = (Input + Output Tokens) ÷ Total Time (sec)

13. Embedding Cost
Cost = (Tokens ÷ 1000) × Embedding Token Rate

14. RAG Recall Efficiency (%)
Recall Rate = Relevant Documents Retrieved ÷ Total Retrieved × 100

15. Vector DB Savings
Savings = ((Full Input Cost – Pre-filtered Input Cost) ÷ Full Input Cost) × 100

Groundedness Facts & Insights
Context-aware compression techniques like RAG reduce token redundancy by 40–60%.

Gemini 1.5 Flash offers low–latency performance ideal for real–time task execution under 200ms.

Inference cost optimization includes load–balancing between small and large models based on complexity.

LLM response latency is generally proportional to output token length.

Cost per response can be reduced by truncating long completion outputs using stop sequences.

For high concurrency environments, smaller models reduce latency bottlenecks in synchronous workflows.

Using embeddings for pre-filtering data reduces full-model invocation frequency and total compute cost.

Cost & ROI Metrics
Token Cost Formula (Standard)
Total Cost = ((Input Tokens ÷ 1000) × Input Rate) + ((Output Tokens ÷ 1000) × Output Rate)

Monthly Cost Estimation
Monthly Cost = Average Tokens per Query × Queries per Month ÷ 1000 × Token Rate

ROI Calculation
ROI (%) = ((Manual Cost – AI Cost) ÷ AI Cost) × 100

Model-Specific Information & Use Cases
Legal Use Case: In legal, LLMs help in summarizing contracts, identifying clauses, and drafting NDAs.
