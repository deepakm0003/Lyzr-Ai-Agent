  "examples": "\nUser Input:\n“We want to implement AI for handling customer support emails. What should we use?”\n\nAgent Response:\n\nAnalyzing use case: Automated email response\n\nLLM Comparison:\n- GPT-4o-mini: $0.50 / 1M tokens — balanced latency and quality  \n- Claude 3 Sonnet: $3.00 / 1M tokens — high comprehension, costly  \n- Amazon Nova: $0.25 / 1M tokens — low cost, good for standard replies  \n\nRecommendation: Use Amazon Nova for template-based replies. Use Claude for escalated queries only. This reduces cost by ~70% with hybrid routing.\n\nTip: Fine-tune prompt reuse, batch queries for cost-efficiency.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Input:\n“Which LLM is best for real-time document summarization in our internal system?”\n\nAgent Response:\n\nUse case: Real-time internal summarization\n\nLLM Comparison:\n- GPT-4o-mini: Low latency, accurate summaries, ~$0.50 / 1M tokens  \n- Claude 3 Sonnet: Higher cost, deeper understanding, ~$3.00 / 1M tokens  \n- Amazon Nova: Extremely fast and cheapest, ~$0.25 / 1M tokens  \n\nSuggestion: Use Amazon Nova for speed and budget-friendly ops. Use GPT-4o-mini for better summarization of large or diverse text.\n\nOptimization Strategy: Schedule summarization during off-peak hours & use shared context memory to reduce token usage.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Input:\n“We’re building a chatbot for onboarding new users to our platform. What do you suggest?”\n\nAgent Response:\n\nIntent: Onboarding Chatbot\n\nLLM Options:\n- GPT-4o-mini: Conversational, low cost, ~90ms latency  \n- Claude 3 Sonnet: Very helpful in ambiguous scenarios but more expensive  \n- Mistral (via Bedrock): Good general-purpose performance at ~$0.35 / 1M tokens  \n\nBest Pick: GPT-4o-mini or Mistral for scalable, cost-efficient onboarding.\n\nOptimize By:\n- Reusing similar prompts  \n- Caching frequent outputs  \n- Disabling verbose system messages\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Input:\n“We want a low-latency model for fast input classification.”\n\nAgent Response:\n\nUse case: Input Classification\n\nModel Comparison:\n- Amazon Nova: Ultra-low latency, cheap (~$0.25 / 1M tokens)  \n- Mistral: Good balance of speed and intelligence  \n- Claude 3 Sonnet: High-quality but slower and costly  \n\nChoose Amazon Nova for max speed. If more accuracy is required, hybrid with Mistral.\n\nCost Tips: Preprocess inputs to avoid unnecessary tokenization. Trim whitespace, clean headers.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Input:\n“What’s the cheapest model for basic text generation?”\n\nAgent Response:\n\nUse case: Basic Text Generation\n\nPricing Overview:\n- Amazon Nova: $0.25 / 1M tokens  \n- Mistral: $0.35 / 1M tokens  \n- GPT-4o-mini: $0.50 / 1M tokens  \n\nWinner: Amazon Nova for cost-sensitive use cases\n\nOptimization Tips:\n- Use temperature=0.7, max tokens=250  \n- Batch text generation in API calls  \n- Reuse response templates where possible\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Input:\n“Which LLM is better if I care about balanced performance and pricing?”\n\nAgent Response:\n\nCriteria: Balanced performance & pricing\n\nOptions:\n- GPT-4o-mini: Great balance for $0.50 / 1M tokens  \n- Mistral (via Bedrock): Lower cost, slightly less accuracy — $0.35 / 1M  \n- Claude 3 Sonnet: High quality, $3.00 / 1M tokens  \n\nRecommendation: Start with GPT-4o-mini for general use. Test Mistral for static queries. Reserve Claude only for critical business logic.\n\nPro Tip: Evaluate usage via monthly inference logs & run a cost audit every 2 weeks.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Input:\nWe want to summarize 2,000 reports monthly, each around 800 tokens.
