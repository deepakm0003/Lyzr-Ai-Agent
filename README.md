# 🤖 Lyzr Ai Agent - AI Cost Optimization Advisor for Enterprises 🤖

## Overview

This project is an **AI-powered cost optimization advisor** built using **Lyzr Studio**, integrated with **Amazon Bedrock**, and powered by **Claude 3.5 v2 Sonnet (Anthropic)**. It is designed to help enterprise users make smart, cost-efficient decisions when selecting and deploying large language models (LLMs) for various business use cases.

- **Agentic UI (Frontend Simulation – Optional Interface):**  
  [👉 Open UI/UX Demo Page](https://costoptimization.netlify.app/)

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Intelligent agent for cost-performance model recommendations
- ✅ Real-time LLM comparisons (Claude, GPT-4o-mini, Amazon Nova, Mistral)
- ✅ Monthly cost & ROI estimation
- ✅ Cost optimization strategies (prompt reuse, batching, hybrid model usage)
- ✅ Structured output in both natural language and JSON
- ✅ Integrated knowledge base for token pricing and best practices
- ✅ Fallback Agentic UI for production simulation

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Lyzr Studio** – Agent orchestration, input/output design, testing
- **Amazon Bedrock** – Secure model deployment layer
- **Claude 3.5 v2 Sonnet** – High-performance LLM for core reasoning
- **Custom Knowledge Base** – External docs from AWS, OpenAI, and Anthropic
- **Agentic UI (optional)** – Custom frontend simulating production access

## 📦 How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   The user provides their business use case, cost sensitivity, and performance constraints.

2. **Agent Logic:**  
   The agent analyzes the task, fetches model comparisons from the knowledge base, estimates cost & ROI, and provides tailored recommendations.

3. **Output Format:**  
   Dual-format:
   - Natural language summary (for business decision-makers)
   - JSON structured response (for developers & analysts)

4. **Optimization Insights:**  
   Suggestions include:
   - When to switch models (e.g., Claude → Nova)
   - How to reduce token usage
   - Batching similar requests
   - Using hybrid pipelines

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- “Which LLM should we use for summarizing customer feedback at scale?”
- “Estimate the monthly cost of using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for internal document processing.”
- “How can we reduce token cost while maintaining accuracy?”
