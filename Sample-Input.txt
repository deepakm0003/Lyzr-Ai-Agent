We're building an AI solution to automatically respond to support emails. We want the most cost-effective model with decent speed. Can you suggest the best LLM and estimate monthly costs if we handle 30,000 queries per month?


Our analytics team runs ~10,000 short SQL query reviews per month. Each takes about 1 minute to verify manually. Analysts charge ₹700/hour. Suggest the most cost-effective GenAI model to automate this process. Estimate monthly usage cost in USD and INR, and compute ROI.


We are building a chatbot for our e-commerce site that handles ~500 product-related queries per hour. The average customer expects a reply within 2 seconds. Some questions are complex (e.g., product compatibility), while others are simple (e.g., price, availability). Recommend a combination of GenAI models to handle both types of queries with optimal latency and accuracy. Justify the trade-off and suggest fallback mechanisms.
